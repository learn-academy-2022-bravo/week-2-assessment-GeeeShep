# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

  Your answer: the parameter is the like the placeholder inside a function whereas an argument is the actual info passed into the function

  Researched answer: a parameter is used to refer to the variable found in the functions definition, its a special variable used to pass info into functions. The argument is the value passed into the parameter of the given function. We pass the values when we call it.




2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: I believe index and value. Sorry, but Im not sure what the others are if there are more. 

  Researched answer:So the predetermined paramaters for the .map method are valus, array , index and "this". As the names implies they hold the value of the current element. "This" value is  optional that holds the value to the function.  



3. What is the difference between map and filter? 

  Your answer:they both are built-in-methods, where .map takes an array and returns a new array while .filter returns a new array but without the unwanted items

  Researched answer: JavaScript arrays have a built-in map method that returns a new array, where each element in the new array is the result of the  element in the old array after being passed through a provided function, while the filter method allows us to filter through an array - iterating over the existing values, and then returns only the ones that fit certain condition, into a new array.



4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer: Function is the instructions or task being done where a method is a type of way to perfom that function

  Researched answer: function is a block of code that is written to perfom a specific set of tasks while a method is a property of an object that contains the function definietion. 



5. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: Something to do with breaking down an object.

  Researched answer: This is an expression that extracts data from arrays,objects and maps and use them as new variables.



6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: Im not sure what this means

  Researched answer: This  is Javascriptâ€™s default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of their functional scope.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Class Inheritance: this lets us create a new class as the child of another class (the parent). This allows code to be more efficient and concise.

2. React: This is a library for building user interfaces like websites and web applications

3. React state: an object that determines how that component renders & behaves. It is what allows you to create components that are dynamic and interactive

4. React lifecycle methods: A series of events within react that happens from the birt of a component to its death
